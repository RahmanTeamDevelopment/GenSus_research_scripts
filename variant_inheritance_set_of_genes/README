1	INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------

This script, given affection and relationship infromation of families being studied, 
outputs a detailed summary of variants that passed some requirements, together with information about the type of inheritance and whether a trio was analyzed or not.
Requirements, meaning variants should be:
		
		within a certain set of genes, given as input
		not IMPACT 3 (besides SYs)
		Minor Allele Frequency ICR1000 < 0.5%
		Minor Allele Frequency ExAC <0.5%
		
		

2	DOCUMENTATION
------------------------------------------

	=======
	RUNNING
	=======

The script can be run with the following command:
/path/to/variant_inheritance_set_of_genes.py -I input.txt --genes genes_list.txt

	=======
	 INPUT
	=======
	
The script requires 2 command line arguments:

-I input.txt: 
Tab separated file with sampleIDs information
File must have header satring with '#'
Make sure that the sample_ID_annotated_calls.txt (generated by OpEx) exists in the path_samples (defined in the beginning of the script)
				
		#Sample_ID	Family_ID	Relationship	Affected?
		_________________________________________________
				
		Relationship column can get only one of the following (case sensitive):
			Father, Mother, Proband, Proband_n (n=1,2...) and any other members
				
		Affected? column can get only one of the following (case sensitive):
			Affected, Unaffected, Unknown
						
						
		Ex:
		#Sample_ID	Family_ID	Relationship	Affected?
		D156399		COG1874 	Proband 	Affected
		D156400		COG1874		Mother  	Unaffected
		D158283		COG1874		Father  	Unaffected

						
--genes genes_list.txt:

Txt file with list of genes, each gene in a new line
No header required
gene = gene symbol as in the GENE column in sample_ID_annotated_calls.txt

	=======
	OUTPUT
	=======

VariantInheritanceSummary_setOfGenes.txt:

TSV file with the following columns (for first 23 columns see CAVA Documentation):

1)	CHROM
2)	POS
3)	REF
4)	ALT
5)	QUAL
6)	QUALFLAG	
7)	FILTER
8)	TR	
9)	TC
10)	SAMPLE
11)	GT
12)	TYPE
13)	TRANSCRIPT

14)	GENE
	only variants within the genes, listed in the genes_list.txt file, will be outputted 

15)	TRINFO
16)	LOC
17)	CSN
18)	CLASS
19)	SO

20)	IMPACT
	variants with IMPACT=3, besides SYs are filtered
	
21)	ALTANN
22)	ALTCLASS
23)	ALTSO
24)	CountICR1000 - Number of times ENST+CSN is seen in ICR1000 series, i.e variant count

25)	MAF_ICR1000 - Minor Allele Frequency in ICR1000 (%)
	only variants with MAF_ICR1000<0.5% are outputted
	
26)	CountInHouse419 - Number of times ENST+CSN is seen in InHouse419 series, i.e variant count
27)	CountExacNFE - Number of times ENST+CSN is seen in ExAC NFE series, i.e variant count
28)	CountExacTotal - Number of times ENST+CSN is seen in the full ExAC series, i.e variant count

29)	MAF_ExAC - Minor Allele Frequency in ExAC (%)
	only variants with MAF_ExAC<0.5% are outputted
	
30)	Trio_analyzed - 'yes'/'no' whether a trio was analyzed for this proband
31)	NumSamplesPerFamily - number of samples in the family, used for the analysis
32)	Inheritance - affection status of parent, can be one of the following:

		no_parents
							
		not_in_only_parent
		inherited_from_only_unaffected
		inherited_from_only_affected
		inherited_from_only_unknown
							
		inherited_from_unaffected
		inherited_from_affected
		inherited_from_unknown
		inherited_from_parent (special case where both parents have the variant & are heterozygous & only one is affected)
		inherited_from_unaffected_Mother (in X-linked genes)
		inherited_from_unaffected_Father (in X-linked genes)
							
		de_novo
							
33)	Family_ID - from input.txt file
34)	Relationship - from input.txt file
35) 	Affected - from input.txt file
